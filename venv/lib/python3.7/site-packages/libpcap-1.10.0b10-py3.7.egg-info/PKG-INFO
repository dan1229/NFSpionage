Description: libpcap
        =======
        
        Python binding for the *libpcap* C library.
        
        Overview
        ========
        
        | Python |package_bold| module is a low-level binding for *libpcap* C library.
        | It is an effort to allow python programs full access to the API provided
          by the well known *libpcap* Unix C library and by its implementations
          provided under Win32 systems by such packet capture systems as:
          `WinPcap <https://www.winpcap.org/>`__,
          `Npcap <https://nmap.org/npcap/>`__
        |
        | |package_bold| is a lightweight Python package, based on the *ctypes* library.
        | It is fully compliant implementation of the original C *libpcap* from
          1.0.0 up to 1.9.0 API and the *WinPcap*'s 4.1.3 libpcap (1.0.0rel0b) API
          by implementing whole its functionality in a clean Python instead of C.
        |
        | Useful *libpcap* API documentation can be found at:
        
          | `Main pcap man page <https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/pcap.3pcap.html>`__,
          | `(MORE pcap man pages) <https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/>`__
        
        About original LIBPCAP:

        Anonymous Git is available via:

        formerly from:
        
          | Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory
          | Network Research Group <libpcap@ee.lbl.gov>

        This directory contains source code for libpcap, a system-independent
        interface for user-level packet capture.  libpcap provides a portable
        framework for low-level network monitoring.  Applications include
        network statistics collection, security monitoring, network debugging,
        etc.  Since almost every system vendor provides a different interface
        for packet capture, and since we've developed several tools that
        require this functionality, we've created this system-independent API
        to ease in porting and to alleviate the need for several
        system-dependent packet capture modules in each application.
        
        For some platforms there are README.{system} files that discuss issues
        with the OS's interface for packet capture on those platforms, such as
        how to enable support for that interface in the OS, if it's not built in
        by default.
        
        The libpcap interface supports a filtering mechanism based on the
        architecture in the BSD packet filter.  BPF is described in the 1993
        Winter Usenix paper "The BSD Packet Filter: A New Architecture for
        User-level Packet Capture".  A compressed PostScript version can be
        found at:
        
            ftp://ftp.ee.lbl.gov/papers/bpf-usenix93.ps.Z
        
        or:

        A PDF version can be found at:
        
            https://www.tcpdump.org/papers/bpf-usenix93.pdf
        
        Although most packet capture interfaces support in-kernel filtering,
        libpcap utilizes in-kernel filtering only for the BPF interface.
        On systems that don't have BPF, all packets are read into user-space
        and the BPF filters are evaluated in the libpcap library, incurring
        added overhead (especially, for selective filters).  Ideally, libpcap
        would translate BPF filters into a filter program that is compatible
        with the underlying kernel subsystem, but this is not yet implemented.
        
        BPF is standard in 4.4BSD, BSD/OS, NetBSD, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFly
        BSD, and Mac OS X; an older, modified and undocumented version is
        standard in AIX.  DEC OSF/1, Digital UNIX, Tru64 UNIX uses the
        packetfilter interface but has been extended to accept BPF filters
        (which libpcap utilizes).  Also, you can add BPF filter support to
        Ultrix using the kernel source and/or object patches available in:
        
            https://www.tcpdump.org/other/bpfext42.tar.Z
        
        Linux, in the 2.2 kernel and later kernels, has a "Socket Filter"
        mechanism that accepts BPF filters; see the README.linux file for
        information on configuring that option.
        
        Note to Linux distributions and \*BSD systems that include libpcap:
        
        There's now a rule to make a shared library, which should work on Linux
        and \*BSD, among other platforms.
        
        It sets the soname of the library to "libpcap.so.1"; this is what it
        should be, *NOT* libpcap.so.1.x or libpcap.so.1.x.y or something such as
        that.
        
        We've been maintaining binary compatibility between libpcap releases for
        quite a while; there's no reason to tie a binary linked with libpcap to
        a particular release of libpcap.
